Practically speaking, you should look at the deliverables in the repository instead of these generated PDFs.

The Github account 'dan7800' was given access to the github repo, although it is publicly accessible anyway.

No specific user accounts are needed to access the VCS.
The app currently requires the use of a test user:

###### Test User

UserName: irtayjdcsv_1551905442@tfbnw.net
