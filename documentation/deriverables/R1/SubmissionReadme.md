An account for our system will automatically be created once you sign in using your Facebook account.
Depending on time allocated, full login may not be implemented.
Instead, a user account will be generated regardless of provided credentials.
A compile time variable is used to switch between using a future that contacts Facebook, or creating a dummy account.
