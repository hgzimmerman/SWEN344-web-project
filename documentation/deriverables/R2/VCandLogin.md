Practically speaking, you should look at the deliverables in the repository instead of these generated PDFs given gross formatting errors resulting from compiling markdown to LaTeX to produce those PDFs.

The VCS is publicly accessible and does not require any specific access to look at or run the code.

No specific user accounts are baked into the system.
Instead, when you allow the app to use your twitter identity, a new record connected to your twitter account is created in the database.
This user record is then associated with your unique twitter user id, allowing different logins to associate your twitter account with persisted data in our system.
