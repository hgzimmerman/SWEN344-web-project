## Bug Tracking

#### Methodology
Bug tracking was handled via the same interface as our feature issues.
This was done through GitHub's Kanban-style projects board feature, accessible [here](https://github.com/hgzimmerman/SWEN344-web-project/projects/).

As bugs were discovered, issues corresponding to the bug were entered into the project board in the `To Do` column.
As they were claimed for work. they would be moved to the `In Progress` column.
When fixed, they would be moved to the `Done` column.

#### Bug Counts and Analysis

##### Backend
The backend was mostly finished and tested by the time dependent work on the frontend started.
As consequence, few bug reports were lodged against it.
