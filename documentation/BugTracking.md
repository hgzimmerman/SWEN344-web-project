## Bug Tracking

### Methodology
Bug tracking was handled via the same interface as our feature issues.
This was done through GitHub's Kanban-style projects board feature, accessible [here](https://github.com/hgzimmerman/SWEN344-web-project/projects/).

As bugs were discovered, issues corresponding to the bug were entered into the project board in the `To Do` column.
As they were claimed for work. they would be moved to the `In Progress` column.
When fixed, they would be moved to the `Done` column.

### Bug Counts and Analysis

###### Backend
The backend was mostly finished and tested by the time dependent work on the frontend started.
As consequence, few bug reports were lodged against it.

###### Frontend


#### How many bugs did you collect?


#### How many open bugs do you have? And why are they open?


#### How has the bug collection/mitigation process helped or hurt your project.
There is an inherent time overhead to tracking bugs in an informal manner instead of just telling each other to fix them when we meet.
Formally keeping track of them provides a means to ensure that each bug is addressed or at least known about.
